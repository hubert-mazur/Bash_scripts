# Bash_scripts

#### This repository contain some bash scripts, that I have already written. Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

#### More detailed description of scripts:

1. Set up Workspace folder- useful for C, C++ programming:

--> `ReadMe.txt` provides usage information

--> `install.sh` installation script

--> `CmakeLists.txt` Cmake file, each time copied to current script run localization

--> `set_w_space.sh` Most important part, creates whole working space with necessary directories. 

2. .shp file creator:

--> `File_creator.sh` creates .txt files with the same names as .shp files.

3. Compressing script

--> `Packer.sh` is a funny script, that allows to compress given file as many times as your machine can stand! Useful for annoying your friends. Use wisely!
